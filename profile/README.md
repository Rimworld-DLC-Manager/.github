## 💾 Automatic Activation (Recommended)
### Get CreamAPI and follow the instructions
- Get the latest release.
- Extract the archive anywhere you like (it’s fully portable), launch CreamAPI and follow the instructions.

## 💾 Manual Activation (Optional)

If you prefer to manually verify or manage the files:

- Navigate to  
...\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\
- Open the **`Data`** folder and ensure the DLC folders (e.g., `Royalty`, `Biotech`, etc.) are present.  
- Open each DLC’s folder → `About` → `about.xml`.  
- Confirm that no “license verification” lines are present (CreamAPI should handle this automatically).  
- Launch RimWorld and check DLC activation in the main menu.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|----------|-----------|
| DLCs not showing in-game | Ensure CreamAPI was run as Administrator and restart Steam. |
| Game crashes after launch | Use the “Uninstall” option in CreamAPI and reinstall unlockers. |
| Missing DLL errors | Reinstall Koaloader via CreamInstaller’s context menu. |
| Still doesn’t work | Re-run CreamAPI and refresh Steam appinfo for RimWorld. |
